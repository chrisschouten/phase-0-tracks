# # In phase-0-tracks/ruby/iteration.rb, declare an array and a hash, and populate each of them with some data. We don't care what data you use, but it shouldn't be nonsense data -- it should represent a reasonable scenario in which those data structures would be used. (A hash full of random letters and numbers, for instance, is not as meaningful as a hash that associates Hollywood actors with their best-known character.)

# # Demonstrate that you can iterate through each one using .each, and then using .map! (modifying the data in some way). Note that you can't call .map! on a hash, so you can skip that (.map returns an array, so a destructive map method is logically impossible on a hash). Print the data structures before and after each call to demonstrate whether they have been modified or not.

# A method that filters a data structure for only items that do satisfy a certain condition (for example, keeping any numbers that are less than 5).
# A different method that filters a data structure for only items satisfying a certain condition -- Ruby offers several options!
