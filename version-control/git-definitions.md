# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
the task of keeping a software system consisting of many versions and configurations well organized.  Version control systems are essential for any form of distributed, collaborative development. Whether it is the history of a wiki page or large software development project, the ability to track each change as it was made, and to reverse changes when necessary can make all the difference between a well managed and controlled process and an uncontrolled ‘first come, first served’ system.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
Branching, in revision control and software configuration management, is the duplication of an object under revision control (such as a source code file or a directory tree) so that modifications can happen in parallel along both branches. Branches are also known as trees, streams or codelines.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
When you're ready to save a copy of the current state of the project, you stage changes with git add . After you're happy with the staged snapshot, you commit it to the project history with git commit . The git add command should not be confused with svn add , which adds a file to the repository.
* What is a merge conflict?
cases where one branch has modified a file while the other didn't, or   where both branches contain the same new version of the file. 3/11/2016
